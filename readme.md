## Installation Using Terminal

*****Need C compiler installed prior to install (I use [tdm-gcc](https://jmeubank.github.io/tdm-gcc/))***

1. Clone the project to desired location:
```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Flapjacck/Simple-BlackJack.git
```

2. Change directory to inside "\Simple-BlackJack\\" folder:
```
  cd simple-blackjack
```

3. Run the make file to compile the program:
```
  make
```

4. Open "*SimpleBJ.exe*" to run the program

- The "*score.txt*" file location is offset if you are on Mac. To fix this replace line 56 in "*main.c*" with your local "*score.txt*" file path:
```
Line 56 | Replace "simple-blackjack/score.txt" with (EX. "Desktop/Simple-BlackJack/Simple-BlackJack/score.txt")
```

## How to Play BlackJack

- Player attempts to beat the dealer by getting a count as close to 21 as possible, without going over 21 or having a higher count than the dealer
- Dealer stands on 17 - 21
- Instant win when Player is dealt six cards
- Player win pays 1:1 | Natural BlackJack pays 3:2 | Insurance pays 2:1

## F.A.Q

Q: Make file gives a error "#include <windows.h> not found"

A: Most likely your on Mac and havent deleted the necessary code (check instalation step #3)
